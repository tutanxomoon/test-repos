 <h1>Superhero trivia</h1>
<h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
<p>A <b> superhero is a person who does heroic </b> deeds and has the ability to do
    them in a way that a normal person couldn't.
    So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is
    more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,
    and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.

<br>
<p> By analyzing adaptations of several superheroes, we can determine their specific characteristics that prove so heroic to the wide range of audiences.
    Usually, the television adaptations show greater advancement in the superheroâ€™s personality than movie adaptations mainly due 
    to the fact that there is more time the audience gets to spend with the characters on screen,
    so therefore the writers can delve deeper into the characterization.</p>
